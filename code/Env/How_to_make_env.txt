To freeze/export:
conda activate env
conda env export > environment.yml

To import/install:
mamba env create -f ENVIRONMENT.yml
# Can use conda instead of mamba
mamba env create -f Env_NBr7.yml

Then pip install -e C:\OD\WS_Mdl\code


ATTENTION! Always make a new .yml file for a run where changes have been made to the env since the previous run. Then update the env version in the RunLog/PP_Ctrl s/s.
