# Introduction
This project folder is used for the purposes of WaterScape Regional Groundwater modelling.<br>
From this point on, abbreviations/acronyms defined in .\Mng\Acronyms.xlsx are used (to save time and space).<br>
Initially, this folder is being set up in my (Marios Karampasis) OneDrive. The project software requires windows to run, so unfortunately it's only possible to work on this project from a Win machine. To avoid potential errors caused by OneDrive's default name (includes a hyphen and spaces), make a permanent symbolic link on your C: drive using the following command in your CMD:<br>
mklink /D C:\OD "C:\Users\<User>\OneDrive - Universiteit Utrecht"<br>
(change the OneDrive directory to whatever it needs to be)<br>

The symbolic link can be deleted using:<br>
rmdir C:\OD

All files you need to run the models should be available within this project folder. The only thing you need to install yourself is the python environment - use the guide below.

# Rules and Tips
- .\Mng\Acronyms.xlsx contains acronyms and rules used throughout the project.  This is not just an acronym archive. It also explains the naming convention used throughout this project, so you need to be familiar with its principles when working on with this folder/project. New acronyms should be registered there. Make sure you read the instructions sheet/tab to understand the acronym system, and follow the system's rules when adding new shortcuts/abbreviations.
- The folder is version controlled through GitHub (smaller files, e.g. code) (and DVC). You can use "git ls-files" to print all Git tracked files, and "dvc list . --dvc-only --recursive" (warning, it's very slow), to print the files tracked with each of the two methods. Make sure you push at frequent intervals.
- For good data management, it's advised to include meta-data in data folder that are not self-explanatory. E.g. a read-me file in a folder with IDFs (IDFs may contain spatial data, units etc. but oftentimes their origin/method of production, which can be very useful, is missing from the meta-data).

# Folder structure/description
Files that are specific to one of the models will be contained withing the folder of that model. The rest of the folders in this directory should contain files that are (or will be) used by/for multiple models.<br>
Below is a brief description of what is contained within each of the main folders of this directory.<br>
- code: Contains scripts and code. Sub-folders grouped by function/purpose.
- data: Contains data not specific to one model (e.g. KNMI climate TS).
- Mng: Contains files used for managing the project. WS_RunLog.xlsx is used to keep track of runs. It reads log.csv, where Sim info is recorded as the Sim is being executed.
- models: Contains a sub-folder for each model used in the project. All data/files related to just one of the models belong inside those sub-folders. If no metadata about the file source is provided, asume the source is the Deltares P: drive (e.g. for NBr: under p:\archivedprojects\11209224-sponswerkingnl\ or p:\archivedprojects\11206534-002-imod-brabantsedelta\)<br>
the models folder structure is described in more detail below because it is complex and critical for the project.
- other: Files relevant to the project that don't belong in any of the other categories/folders.
- software: Contains modelling softwareÂ 
- SS: Superseded - anything not relevant anymore. (although superseded files can be found in other sub-folders too.

## Models
All model sub-folders contain the same folder structure for consistency. Files in those folders are only relevant to this Mdl. The Fo Str is described below:
- code: Contains code specific to each Mdl. e.g. Mdl_Prep contains the .bat & .ini file to prepare a Mdl run.
- doc: self-explanatory
- In: model inputs, organized by iMOD package/module (organized by type). Raw data shouldnt' be stored here. It's ok to have MtDt files and/or rasters here (for ease of use). It's even ok to have simple code too, but if it's routine code it needs to be moved somewhere more central (./code of ./models/*/code).
- PoP: Contains post-processed (PoPed) files. More specifically:
	common:	general information layers, e.g. rivers, background map etc. - Those elements are used in the MM regardless of run.
	In:		files converted to GIS layers for review and visualization. Most inputs remain the same as the B for a run, but some have to be re-referenced on each Sim. This is done by changing the data-source of the layer (programmatically).
	Clc_In:	shapefiles created from In Calcs. e.g. transmissivity = K * b (thickness)
	Out		contains a model map for each Sim. Post processed output (PoPed Out) is unique to each Sim. Thus, the baseline MM gets copied and the output layers, which are relatively referenced, automatically get linked to the new Sim's PoPed Out.
- PrP: Pre-Processing. Can include raw or intermediate data, or even scripts/JupNotes to create the In files.
- Sim: Simulation folders. 1 for each Sim. Unfortunately, the way iMOD is designed, Mdl Output needs to be saved here. Organized by Sim.

# Guide to install SW for this project
(optional software starts with "Opt:", the rest is mandatory)

0. symlink OneDrive (this will be useful later)
cmd.exe
mklink /D C:\OD "C:\Users\<User>\OneDrive - Universiteit Utrecht"

1. Opt:	Double Commander
cd "C:\Users\mkarampasi\OneDrive - Universiteit Utrecht\Software\InstalledOutsideSoftwareCenter"
.\doublecmd-1.1.22.x86_64-win64.exe <br>
Opt: replace files in C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\doublecmd\ with files in C:\OD\Software\Settings\Double Commander\ (might need to enable view Hidden files)

2. Python Env (with snakmake)
Install the python env necessary for this project following this guide:
./code/Env/how_to_make_Env.txt
(C:\OD\WS_Mdl\code\Env\How_to_make_env.txt)

3. (Opt: PS7 - #666 I should make a guide later)

4. (Opt: QGIS - #666 I should make a guide later. This is only needed on the PC used for reviewing outputs)

## Terminal tools

There is a list of terminal tools that facilitate common tasks for this project. Those are listed in C:/OD/WS_Mdl/code/setup.py, with a brief description.<br>
To add another terminal command, you need to add it to the setup file (similar to the other commands), and make a script. Then you need to run step 2 from the python Env installation guide above.<br>
It's also possible to run python function from C:\OD\WS_Mdl\code\WS_Mdl\WS_Mdl.py via "WS_Mdl <function> <arg1> <arg2> ...".
